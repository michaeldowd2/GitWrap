# GitWrap - WORK IN PROGRESS

## What is this?
An ultra-low maintainance javascript site generator for public github repositories.
- Create a 'site' in the browser using a public github repo, for free, no sign-up, no install and instantly get a sharable link. 
- Or, copy the index.html to your repo, update the REPO constant in the html and use github pages for a nicer URL.

## Why?

## How?
Using javascript calls to the github api, the site retrieves a list of folders and content from the provided repo, then dresses this content up in some html and css for presenting to the world.
